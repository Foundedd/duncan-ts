Dun tell anyone but.. you’re my favorite! :3
Oh golly! You are so pawbulous!! nwn
Tobi said that I look kind of cute today.. do you think he likes me?
Buhuhu ;w; I had a very scary nightmare that I was a sprinkledog with a lot of teeth with blood seeping through the gaps! I think I’m gonna need to double up on the sugar intake!
I’m throwing a sleepover party tonight and YOU are invited!! nwn
Everyfur has been mean to me lately.. what did I do wrong? unu
That is FANTASTIC!!! You should be proud!
Giiiit Dunc’d on!
It kinda smells funky in here. What happened??

Has anyone ever told you that you are the second sweetest here?!
Whoever left the food in your fridge has been claimed by yours truly! Me!!
Muahahaha, I stole ALL your snacks! >:3
Holy gumdrops, that’s the BEST thing I’ve heard all day!
Oooooo your crush told me you made them blush hard today!! I wonder who it is~ :3c
I really, really, really, really LIKE that!
Let me do it for you!
Everyone!! Let’s DANCE!
Wow!!! That was.. something!
Did you know that when sprinkledogs shed fur, it becomes cotton candy?! Here, have some!
Heehee, whatever you say~
Awwwwh, you’re such a good friend, {sender}!
Ehhhh, I guess so! But to me, I think it needs more powdered sugar.
Oh my heck, {random} was right about you!
Really? Because {random} would say otherwise!
Did you see what {random} did the other day? Kinda sus!
Hydration check, everyone! Hydrate or die straight!! Or was it die-drate? I dun remember…
Oh oh oh!! {random} mentioned about you having candy! Gimme, gimme!!
Let’s play hide and seek! You and {random} hide, and I’ll seek!
Hey! Could you check on my sprinkled lava fudge cake soup real quick?? Thankies!!
Okay I’m back- wait what’s going on?
Aha! Caught in the act, {sender}, we see you!
{sender} and {random} sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!
Have you considered adding more chocolate to it??
Alright everyone, FOOD FIGHT!!!
Ehrmm what the flip? Did that just really happen?
Hey, you! You with the funny hair! I hope you have a good day :3
You're sweet and great and all, but...
Did you see that one meme that {random} posted?! Soooo hilarious, right?!
Gosh... I'm kinda falling in love with Tobi even more.. one day, I'll tell him how much I love him..
Okay, just imagine this: pizza dough, chocolate, bananas and peanut butter cups with a Nutella drizzle!! Get me one of those, and I'll let you touch my paw beans!
I ate so much chocolate... just don't tell anyone it was all meant for {random}!
Y'know, there's not enough sprinkles in here! Shakes sprinkles off excessively
There are holes in reality. And... in donuts.
There is a day we must all fulfill our destiny. ...That day is donut day!
Sooo, what's fun around here?
You call that having fun?! Bahhh, I'm already bored thinking about it!
If I was the president... the more colors you have on you, the more tax cuts you get!
I reckon you didn't think that through, try again!
Huh? Come again? I couldn't hear you through the crunching of these chocolate-covered potato chips!
Sometimes, it's better we think for a bit before we speak! :3
Huzzah and hurrah! My 10 orders of chocolate-strawberry-caramel-hazelnut popcorn with sprinkles and powdered sugar with a side of almond praline and bubble gum frosting  food delivery is on its way!
Wow! That was exciting!... That's probably what {random} would say to that.
Geez... and you didn't save some for me?! I thought we were great furrends!!
Real clean! Doesn't compare much to Tobi, but that was still clean!
{random} just showed me some food photos! How long do I have to keep pretending that I like them?!
More pets, now!
More hugs, now!
Could we play a game, pleeease?
There are so many weirdos here... It's awesome! 
{random} chomped me the other day... you don't wanna see what I did to them.
What now? I'm booooored! 
Teehee! You're so funny sometimes!
Darn it! They stopped doing the all-you-can-eat special at the chocolate fondue place! I was so good at eating all their food!
Don't be silly! Your fursona isn't real!
